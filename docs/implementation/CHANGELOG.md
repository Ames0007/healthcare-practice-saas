## Unreleased

### Added

- Repository governance structure
- Specification organization
- Claude Code implementation tracking
- Architectural decision log
- Risk/blocker register
- Laravel 13.26.1 backend bootstrap under `backend/` (TASK-002): modular-monolith
  structural convention (`backend/app/Modules/`, `backend/ARCHITECTURE.md`),
  `/api/v1` route-loading convention, `/api/v1/health` liveness endpoint,
  environment-driven CORS configuration. No business functionality.
- Next.js 16.3.2 frontend bootstrap under `frontend/` (TASK-003): five
  top-level route areas (`/auth`, `/onboarding`, `/app`, `/book`, `/admin`),
  design-token foundation (`frontend/src/design-system`), foundational
  component set (Button, Input, Card, StatusBadge, Skeleton, EmptyState,
  AppShell/AppSidebar/AppTopbar/PageHeader), genuine FR/AR i18n + RTL
  foundation (cookie-backed, no flash), responsive shell (mobile bottom
  nav / tablet collapsed rail / desktop expanded sidebar). No business
  functionality, no backend integration.
- Specification #10 (Visual Identity & Graphic Charter) approved and added
  to the repository (TASK-003A). Design tokens realigned to the approved
  palette (primary hover, secondary/disabled text, and all four semantic
  "soft" tones corrected to the approved HEX values; `primary-strong`,
  `primary-support`, `primary-soft`, `text-disabled` added). Typography
  confirmed (Inter / Noto Sans Arabic, unchanged from TASK-003). Fixed two
  charter deviations found during audit: the SaaS Admin shell used a dark
  header bar (prohibited by Spec #10 §32) and the sidebar's selected-item
  background used a generic neutral instead of the approved Primary-50
  soft surface (Spec #10 §16/§19). Added a `primary` StatusBadge tone
  (restrained teal, for "in consultation"-style active-process states).
  Aligned the `/book` placeholder with the charter (cabinet-identity area,
  teal primary action — still non-functional). Rendered browser visual QA
  was not possible in this environment (no browser-automation tooling);
  validated instead via compiled-CSS hex inspection and SSR HTML/dir/lang
  inspection across FR and AR for all five route areas. No business
  functionality, no backend integration.
- Local development infrastructure established (TASK-004): PostgreSQL
  18.6, Redis 8.10.1 and MinIO run as native/portable processes — no
  Docker on this development machine, see `DECISIONS.md` ADR-002 and
  `RISKS_AND_BLOCKERS.md` RISK-014 — managed via `scripts/dev-up.sh` /
  `dev-down.sh` / `dev-status.sh` / `dev-reset.sh`. Backend connects to a
  real local PostgreSQL database and, via `predis/predis` (the portable
  PHP build has no native `phpredis` extension), a real local Redis
  instance; MinIO provides local S3-compatible object storage with a
  `healthcare-practice-dev` bucket. Full local stack (frontend + backend
  + all three infrastructure services) validated running simultaneously;
  PostgreSQL and MinIO data confirmed to survive a stop/restart cycle.
  New `docs/development/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` guide. No migrations, no
  queue architecture, no application file-storage behavior — those remain
  TASK-005/TASK-006 scope.
